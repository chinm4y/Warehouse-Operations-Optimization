# Warehouse Operations Optimization Dashboard

## Overview
Interactive dashboard for analyzing warehouse bottlenecks and optimizing operations. Built with Streamlit and Python.

## Key Features
- Real-time bottleneck identification
- Processing time analysis by hour, category, and order size
- Before/after optimization comparison
- 35-40% efficiency improvement simulation

## Key Findings
- **Peak Hour Congestion**: 2-4 PM shows 40% increase in processing time
- **Electronics Delays**: Take 3x longer than other categories
- **Large Orders**: Create 8-hour bottlenecks

## Optimizations
1. Staggered receiving schedule
2. Category-based processing lanes
3. Bulk order pre-processing
4. Automated validation checkpoints

## Results
- 8-hour reduction for high-volume shipments
- 35-40% overall efficiency gain
- 50% faster electronics processing
